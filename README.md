## React / Redux / Typescript demo

This project demonstrates some of the latest React / Redux / Typescript technologies (as of September 2020).

It includes:

 - Redux Toolkit:
    - createSlice keeps all the Redux code for a feature in one place
    - createAsyncThunk provides streamlined use of redux-thunk
- Redux hooks (useSelector, useDispatch) use simpler syntax than the old Connect statement
 - The useContext / useReducer hooks provide an alternative (non-Redux) way to share state globally
 - The useState hook is used to provide local state
 - React Hook Form simplifies form handling
 - React Testing Library provides helper methods for testing components
